# JS30 Notes

### Day 1
#### JS Drum Key

 - Add event listener to any key pressed on the window

```javascript

window.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
  console.log(msg)
});

```

### Day 2
#### JS and CSS Clock

```css
transform-origin: 100%;
/* Translates the origin point for transformation along the X axis */
```

### Day 3
#### Update CSS Variables with JS

 - Data attributes add items to the object of the DOM node they're at. Cool!

 ```javascript
  const suffix = this.dataset
 ```

### Day 4
#### Array Cardio Day 1
 - Filter: takes an array and filters it to less items than the original

 - Map: Takes an array and gives back a new array -- like a factory machine, that takes a raw material and transforms it, without loss (takes 10 items, return 10 different items)

 - Sort: It... well, sorts the items. It does that by adding a value to an array item if it matches the criteria, and subtracting if it doesn't. Sort goes through all of the items in the array and when it's done, they are sorted with index values in order.

 - Reduce: Loops over the array items accumulating value according to what's specified in the function to reduce it to a single value

**About Callback Functions (aka high-order functions)**

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects; that is, functions are of the type Object and they can be used in a first-class manner like any other object (String, Array, Number, etc.) since they are in fact objects themselves. They can be “stored in variables, passed as arguments to functions, created within functions, and returned from functions”1.

### Day 5
#### Flex Panel Gallery

I should come back to improve this – see commented code for detailed instructions.

### Day 6
#### AJAX Look Ahead

A promise is a request that _may_ return a response. The `fetch()` method will make a promise and `.then()` offers you the response to be used.

```javascript
const prom = fetch(endpoint).then(blob => console.log(blob))

```

To add the data to an array of your own, first transform it to JSON with `blob.json()`:


```javascript
  const endpoint = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29/raw/2bf258763cdddd704f8ffd3ea9a3e81d25e2c6f6/cities.json';

  const cities = []
  const prom = fetch(endpoint).then(blob => blob.json())
```

To add the data to the array, you use push...

```javascript
  const prom = fetch(endpoint)
    .then(blob => blob.json())
    .then(data => cities.push(data))

    // Returns:
    // []
    // 0: Array(1000)[0 … 99]

```

...but it just adds `data` as an array _inside_ the `cities` array! To add each city as a new item in the `cities` array, you have to use a spread:


```javascript
const prom = fetch(endpoint)
  .then(blob => blob.json())
  .then(data => cities.push(...data))
```

The spread (`...`) will _spread_ every new item inside the original array.

### Day 7
#### Array Cardio Day 2

`Array.prototype.some()` Checks if at least one item in your array meets your requirements

---

### Day 8
#### Fun with HTML5 canvas

Inside a `<canvas>` tag there's a context, where you draw pixels. The context can either be 2D or 3D.

---

### Day 9
#### 14 Must Know Dev Tools Tricks

 - Inspect element > right-click > Break on... > attribute modifications

---

### Day 10
#### Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

 - Hold shift and clicking two checkboxes will select all the other ones in between

 - The first thing we need to do is select all the checkboxes because we need to listen to them

---

### Day 11
#### Custom Video Player

 - A good way to think through your application:
 1. Get our elements
 2. Build our Functions
 3. Hook up our event listeners

 - Remember, `this.dataset` returns all data-attr values from the element
 - `parseFloat` will convert a string into number

### Day 12
#### Key Sequence Detection

 - `array.splice` removes items from an array and (optionally) adds others in return. If you splice an array without removing any elements, it will be returned empty.

 ```
   var numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   console.log("numbers = " + JSON.stringify(numbers))

   var result = numbers.splice(1, 2, "one", "two", "two-point-five")

   console.log("spliced!")
   console.log("numbers = " + JSON.stringify(numbers))
   console.log("result = " + JSON.stringify(result))
```
